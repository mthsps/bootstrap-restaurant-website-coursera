# Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4
Course from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Coursera by Professor Jogesh K. Muppala. It explores the Bootstrap library, going through: 

1. Bootstrap overview: grid system; 
2. Bootstrap CSS components: navigation bar, buttons, forms, tables, cards, images and media, tags, alerts and progress bars;
3. Bootstrap JavaScript components: tabs, pills and tabbed navigation, collapse, accordion, scrollspy, affix, tooltips, popovers, modals and the carousel;
4. CSS preprocessors: Less and Sass;

As a hands-on course, throughout the modules, a restaurant website, called “con Fusion”, is built to put concepts learned into practice.  

# Assignments 

## Assignment 1

>  In this assignment you will add a second page, aboutus.html, to your website. You will make use of the Bootstrap skills learnt in this module to prepare this web page for integration into the website.

## Assignment 2

> In this assignment, you will continue to work with the website that you have been developing in the exercises. You will edit the home page (index.html). You will start with the current home page at the end of the last exercise in this module. At the end of this assignment, you should have completed the following tasks: 1. Designed a form to enable users to submit a reservation request for a table; 2. Formatted the contents of the second row of the page using media class; 3. Added a button to the Jumbotron to enable users to access the form to reserve a table at the restaurant.

## Assignment 3

> In this assignment you will remove the tooltip from the Reserve table button. Then you will move the table reservation form into a modal that will be shown when the Reserve Table button is clicked. The updated reservation form will include a new radio button group allowing you to select the smoking/non-smoking section of the restaurant.

## Assignment 4
> In this assignment you will use the JavaScript methods to control the showing and hiding of the modals in the index.html page. You will replace the data-* attributes of the buttons and instead add JavaScript method to control the modals. In addition, you will write some SCSS code to style the modal background.

# Making it run

In the project directory, you can:

## `npm install`

Installs the node modules needed to make the website work.

## `npm start`

Runs the website in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
